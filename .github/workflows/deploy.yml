    # For now, we run it independently or we can duplicate CI steps here if needed, 
    # but usually deployment implies CI passed if we use 'needs' effectively.
    # However, 'build-server' and 'build-client' are in a different file 'ci.yml'.
    # Cross-workflow dependencies are not direct.
    # We will just run deployment on push to main.
